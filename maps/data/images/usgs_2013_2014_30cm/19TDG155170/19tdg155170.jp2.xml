This image in JPEG 2000 format was created from a 30-cm resolution GeoTiff by MassGIS using Lizardtech's GeoExpress 9 Unlimited software. MassGIS received 2014 four band (R,G,B,NIR) 7.5-cm imagery for Cape Cod and resampled the images to 30-cm resolution. MassGIS began distributing the JPEG 2000 versions of the 2014 Cape Cod imagery on March 20, 2015. Technical specifications and accuracy estimates in this metadata document refer to the original 7.5-cm GeoTiffs.  An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 0.38-meters NSSDA 95% confidence (0.22-meters Root Mean Squared (RMSE) Error XY (0.15 meter RMSE X or Y).  Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 750-meter by 750-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U. S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage; appended to the name by way of an underscore is the cardinal direction that identifies the quarter-tileâ€™s location within the 1500-meter by 1500-meter parent tile.  The projected coordinate systems are UTM Zone 18N and UTM Zone 19N with a NAD83 (2011) horizontal datum. Fugro produced this dataset in thirteen production blocks; A3, B1, B2, C2, D, F1, F2, F3, F4, G1, G2, H, and K. Production block A3 was processed and delivered in UTM 18N.  Production blocks B1, B2, C2, D, F1, F2, F3, F4, G1, G2, H, and K were processed and delivered in UTM 19N. Production blocks consist of the following towns - A3: West Springfield; B1: Gardner; B2: Fitchburg and Leominster; C2: Marlborough and Harvard University; D: Westford, Action, Concord, and Harvard University; F1: Seekonk; F2: Easton; F3: Dartmouth; F4: Mattapoisett; G1: Barnstable, Bourne, Brewster, Chatham, Dennis, Eastham, Harwich, Mashpee, Orleans, Sandwich, and Yarmouth; G2: Barnstable, Bourne, Chatham, Dennis, Falmouth, Harwich, Mashpee, Sandwich, and Yarmouth; H: Eastham, Orleans, Provincetown, Truro, and Wellfleet; and K: Beverly, Salem, and Lynn.  This metadata record describes the orthoimagery that was delivered in UTM 19N, unless otherwise stated.</abstract><purpose>This data depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr></attracc><logic>All GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived.

Terrasurv collected 123 ground control points to support the orthoimagery development and 122 check points for quality assurance/quality control validation by the USGS for the entire project area. The National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) was used to provide control for the network. The KeyNet Virtual Reference System (VRS) network, which consists of a network of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS), was used to provide the ties to the NSRS. This network utilizes the CORS stations in the area to compute corrections in real time, which greatly reduces errors due to the satellite ephemerides, clocks, and the ionosphere and troposphere. Corrections are created for a nearby virtual reference station, and these corrections are transmitted over the cellular network to the remote station, resulting in short baselines. The horizontal datum was the North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and the vertical datum was the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, using the GEOID12A model to transform the GRS80 ellipsoidal heights to NAVD88 orthometric heights.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Fugro EarthData, Inc.</origin><pubdate>20140721</pubdate><title>Pixel Factory DEM</title></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>network drives</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20140721</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>surface</srccitea><srccontr>Autocorrelated surface generated to support the development of orthophotography.

The imagery for the entire project area was acquired on April 9, 12, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, and 25, and May 7 and 11, 2014.  Aerotriangulation (AT) is accomplished as a component of Fugroâ€™s exclusive Pixel Factory process.  The ground control, GPS, and IMU information is ingested and tie points between strips are identified.  The AT produces a bundle adjustment for each data block, consisting of multiple lifts.  After the completion of the AT, a set of stereo images in SOCET SET format were generated.  The edited autocorrelated surface model and existing LiDAR surface were imported, merged together and reviewed in the Pixel Factory processing system.  The surface was then used in the orthorectification of the raw ADS80-SH82 imagery.The rectification process was run using the processed DSM on each flight line.  The quicklook (reduced resolution rectification) of each flight line was exported out of Pixel Factory.  Radiometric adjustments were made to the quicklooks using Fugro proprietary tools.  The radiometrically balanced imagery was then re-imported into the Pixel Factory system and the histogram from the quicklook was applied to the full resolution imagery.  Mosaic lines were placed, joining the ADS80 imagery strips.  An initial QA/QC was performed by the technician to ensure that the mosaic lines were appropriately placed and that there was appropriate imagery coverage.  The final imagery data set is removed from the Pixel Factory environment in a process called "packaging" where the individual tiles are created.  All data processing in the Pixel Factory system is performed in UTM meters; it is during packaging that final datum and projection are defined.  The created tiles are reviewed to ensure the output was successful and ground control points are measured and verified for accuracy.  QA/QC was performed looking for anomalies, smears and other indications of problems within the digital orthophoto creation process, and interactive radiometric adjustment applied where needed.  Additional global radiometric adjustments were applied to the completed orthos in Adobe Photoshop to enhance the color as needed.  The final digital ortho products were delivered in GeoTIFF format referenced to UTM zone 19N projection and coordinate system (meters) using horizontal datum NAD83 (2011).  The GeoTIFFs were loaded into LizardTech GeoExpress creating a compressed mosaic in MrSID Gen4 format with a compression ratio of 80:1 referenced to Massachusetts State Plane (Mainland) projection and coordinate system (feet) using horizontal datum NAD83 (2011).  The MrSID mosaics were generated for each AOI covering the area defined by the UTM deliverable extents, null pixel values of white (255) are present wherever the UTM coverage does not fill to the extents of the SID mosaic.  The MrSID mosaics are the only deliverable referenced to Massachusetts State Plane (Mainland).</procdesc><procdate>20141119</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>19</utmzone><transmer><sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer><longcm>-69.000000</longcm><latprjo>0.000000</latprjo><feast>500000.000000</feast><fnorth>0.000000</fnorth></transmer></utm></gridsys><planci><plance>row and column</plance><coordrep><absres>0.075</absres><ordres>0.075</ordres></coordrep><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983 (2011)</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>The JPEG 2000 orthoimagery is organized in four color bands or channels which represent the red, green, blue and near infrared (R,G,B, NIR) portions of the spectrum.
